The generalized cross-correlation method is the most popular technique to do so and is well explained in a landmark paper by Knapp and Carter. In this paper, a new approach is proposed that is based on eigenvalue decomposition. Indeed, the eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the microphone signals contains the impulse responses between the source and the microphone signals (and therefore all the information we need for time delay estimation). In experiments, the proposed algorithm performs well and is very accurate.},

 abstract = {We propose a generic on-line (also sometimes called adaptive or recursive) version of the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm applicable to latent variable models of independent observations. Compared with the algorithm of Titterington, this approach is more directly connected to the usual EM algorithm and does not rely on integration with respect to the complete-data distribution. The resulting algorithm is usually simpler and is shown to achieve convergence to the stationary points of the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the marginal distribution of the observation and the model distribution at the optimal rate, i.e. that of the maximum likelihood estimator. In addition, the approach proposed is also suitable for conditional (or regression) models, as illustrated in the case of the mixture of linear regressions model.},

 abstract = {We deal with recursive direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation of multiple moving sources. Based on the recursive EM algorithm, we develop two recursive procedures to estimate the time-varying DOA parameter for narrowband signals. The first procedure requires no prior knowledge about the source movement. The second procedure assumes that the motion of moving sources is described by a linear polynomial model. The proposed recursion updates the polynomial coefficients when a new data arrives. The suggested approaches have two major advantages: simple implementation and easy extension to wideband signals. Numerical experiments show that both procedures provide excellent results in a slowly changing environment. When the DOA parameter changes fast or two source directions cross with each other, the procedure designed for a linear polynomial model has a better performance than the general procedure. Compared to the beamforming technique based on the same parameterization, our approach is computationally favorable and has a wider range of applications.},

@article{Dorfan2015,

 abstract = {The problem of distributed localization for ad hoc wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) is addressed in this paper. WASNs are characterized by low computational resources in each node and by limited connectivity between the nodes. Novel bi-directional tree-based distributed estimation–maximization (DEM) algorithms are proposed to circumvent these inherent limitations. We show that the proposed algorithms are capable of localizing static acoustic sources in reverberant enclosures without a priori information on the number of sources. Unlike serial estimation procedures (like ring-based algorithms), the new algorithms enable simultaneous computations in the nodes and exhibit greater robustness to communication failures. Specifically, the recursive distributed EM (RDEM) variant is better suited to online applications due to its recursive nature. Furthermore, the RDEM outperforms the other proposed variants in terms of convergence speed and simplicity. Performance is demonstrated by an extensive experimental study consisting of both simulated and actual environments.},

 abstract = {Speech enhancement and separation are core problems in audio signal processing, with commercial applications in devices as diverse as mobile phones, conference call systems, hands-free systems, or hearing aids. In addition, they are crucial preprocessing steps for noise-robust automatic speech and speaker recognition. Many devices now have two to eight microphones. The enhancement and separation capabilities offered by these multi- channel interfaces are usually greater than those of single-channel interfaces. Research in speech enhancement and separation has followed two convergent paths, starting with microphone array processing and blind source separation, respectively. These com- munities are now strongly interrelated and routinely borrow ideas from each other. Yet, a comprehensive overview of the common foundations and the differences between these approaches is lacking at present. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap by analyzing a large number of established and recent techniques according to four transverse axes: 1) the acoustic impulse response model, 2) the spatial filter design criterion, 3) the parameter esti- mation algorithm, and 4) optional postfiltering. We conclude this overview paper by providing a list of software and data resources and by discussing perspectives and future trends in the field.},

It is shown that the OSLS algorithm is mathematically equivalent to the so-called spherical interpolation (SI) method but with less computational complexity. The OSLS/SI method uses spherical equations (instead of hyperbolic equations) and solves them in a least-squares sense. Based on the adaptive eigenvalue decomposition time delay estimation method previously proposed by the same authors and the OSLS source localization algorithm, a real-time passive source localization system for video camera steering is presented. The system demonstrates many desirable features such as accuracy, portability, and robustness},

A geometrical analysis of the image-source principle leads to a closed-form expression describing the energy decay curve, with the resulting formula being valid for a uniform as well as nonuniform definition of the enclosure's six absorption coefficients. The accuracy of the proposed approximation is demonstrated on the basis of impulse-response simulations involving various room sizes and reverberation levels, with uniform and nonuniform sound absorption coefficients. An application example for the proposed method is illustrated by considering the task of predicting an enclosure's reflection coefficients in order to achieve a specific reverberation level. The technique presented in this work enables designers to undertake a preliminary analysis of a simulated reverberant environment without the need for time-consuming image-method simulations.},

 abstract = {These files provide a fast implementation of the image-source model (ISM) for the simulation of room impulse responses (RIRs) in small-room acoustics. This implementation produces RIRs that are virtually identical to those obtained with the standard ISM, but the simulations are up to two orders of magnitude faster. This represents a significant advantage when computing a large number of RIRs, e.g., as in the case of moving sound sources and/or microphone array applications.
These files can be used to simulate a sound source moving in a reverberant environment and generate the corresponding samples of audio data received at one or more microphones. This can be done by simply executing the following two commands:
>> fast{\_}ISM{\_}RIR{\_}bank(my{\_}ISM{\_}setup,'fastISM{\_}RIRs.mat');
>> AuData = ISM{\_}AudioData('fastISM{\_}RIRs.mat',SrcSignalVec);
where SrcSignalVec contains the source signal, and my{\_}ISM{\_}setup.m contains the various user-defined parameters needed for the simulation (room dimensions, positions of the microphones, sound source trajectory, desired reverberation time, etc.). The multi-channel matrix of audio data AuData contains the signals generated at each of the sensors.
These files further allow the user to define a range of simulation parameters such as automatic saving of the audio data into a .mat or .wav file, addition of white noise to the resulting signals, how much to crop the generated impulse responses, different ratios of absorption coefficients in the room, etc.
A full documentation of these files, as well as detailed explanations regarding the simulation process can be found at http://www.eric-lehmann.com . Also, please note that several of these files are identical to those provided on my other page \"Image-source method for room impulse response simulation\" ( http://www.mathworks.com.au/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20962 ).
The method implemented in this Matlab code effectively represents an approximation of the reverberant tail in RIRs, which in turn leads to some limitations in practice (see full documentation for more information). For a majority of applications however, this code should allow users to generate proper ISM-based results in a very efficient manner.

Smart Antenna technology ful ll allthis system requirement very ef ciently, serving different user by radiating narrow beam. Thus the same frequency can be reused even if the user are in the same cell or the user are well separated resulting system capacity improvement. There are two main function of smart antenna, including Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation of user and beamforming towards the user. Successful design of smart antenna depends highly on the performance of DOA estimation algorithm as well as beamforming algorithm. A systematic comparison of the performance of different DOA algorithm like Barlett, Capon, MUSIC has been extensively studied by analyzing the simulation result with MATLAB. Further MUSIC is separately studied in details.},

 abstract = {The reverberation time (RT) is an important parameter for characterizing the quality of an auditory space. Sounds in reverberant environments are subject to coloration. This affects speech intelligibility and sound localization. Many state-of-the-art audio signal processing algorithms, for example in hearing-aids and telephony, are expected to have the ability to characterize the listening environment, and turn on an appropriate processing strategy accordingly. Thus, a method for characterization of room RT based on passively received microphone signals represents an important enabling technology. Current RT estimators, such as Schroeder's method, depend on a controlled sound source, and thus cannot produce an online, blind RT estimate. Here, a method for estimating RT without prior knowledge of sound sources or room geometry is presented. The diffusive tail of reverberation was modeled as an exponentially damped Gaussian white noise process. The time-constant of the decay, which provided a measure of the RT, was estimated using a maximum-likelihood procedure. The estimates were obtained continuously, and an order-statistics filter was used to extract the most likely RT from the accumulated estimates. The procedure was illustrated for connected speech. Results obtained for simulated and real room data are in good agreement with the real RT values.},

 abstract = {A novel direction of arrival (DOA) estimator for concur- rent speakers in reverberant environment is presented. Re- verberation, if not properly addressed, is known to degrade the performance of DOA estimators. In our contribution, the DOA estimation task is formulated as a maximum like- lihood (ML) problem, which is solved using the expectation- maximization (EM) procedure. The received microphone sig- nals are modelled as a sum of anechoic and reverberant com- ponents. The reverberant components are modelled by a time- invariant coherence matrix multiplied by time-varying rever- beration power spectral density (PSD). The PSDs of the ane- choic speech and reverberant components are estimated as part of the EM procedure. It is shown that the DOA esti- mates, obtained by the proposed algorithm, are less affected by reverberation than competing algorithms that ignore the reverberation. Experimental study demonstrates the benefit of the presented algorithm in reverberant environment using measured room impulse responses (RIRs).},

We give a more accurate general mathematical model for ET where an unknown emission density lambda = lambda(x, y, z) generates, and is to be reconstructed from, the number of counts n(*)(d) in each of D detector units d. Within the model, we give an algorithm for determining an estimate lambdainsertion mark of lambda which maximizes the probability p(n(*)|lambda) of observing the actual detector count data n(*) over all possible densities lambda. Let independent Poisson variables n(b) with unknown means lambda(b), b = 1, ..., B represent the number of unobserved emissions in each of B boxes (pixels) partitioning an object containing an emitter. Suppose each emission in box b is detected in detector unit d with probability p(b, d), d = 1, ..., D with p(b,d) a one-step transition matrix, assumed known. We observe the total number n(*) = n(*)(d) of emissions in each detector unit d and want to estimate the unknown lambda = lambda(b), b = 1, ..., B. For each lambda, the observed data n(*) has probability or likelihood p(n(*)|lambda). The EM algorithm of mathematical statistics starts with an initial estimate lambda(0) and gives the following simple iterative procedure for obtaining a new estimate lambdainsertion mark(new), from an old estimate lambdainsertion mark(old), to obtain lambdainsertion mark(k), k = 1, 2, ..., lambdainsertion mark(new)(b)= lambdainsertion mark(old)(b)Sum of (n(*)p(b,d) from d=1 to D/Sum of lambdainsertion mark()old(b('))p(b('),d) from b(')=1 to B), b=1,...B.},

 abstract = {Geometrical acoustics are used as a standard model for room acoustic design and consulting. Research on room acoustic simulation focuses on a more accurate modeling of propagation effects such as diffraction and other wave effects in rooms, and on scattering. Much progress was made in this field so that wave models also (for example, the boundary element method and the finite differences in time domain) can now be used for higher frequencies. The concepts and implementations of room simulation methods are briefly reviewed. After all, simulations in architectural acoustics are indeed powerful tools, but their reliability depends on the skills of the operator who has to create an adequate polygon model and has to choose the correct input data of boundary conditions such as absorption and scattering. Very little is known about the uncertainty of this input data. With the theory of error propagation of uncertainties it can be shown that prediction of reverberation times with accuracy better than the just noticeable difference requires input data in a quality which is not available from reverberation room measurements.},

 abstract = {In the field of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage-Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility.},

A direct localization is obtained when the sound source is placed inside the convex hull of the array. In the far-field case, we demonstrate the localization via the cross bearing from several widely separated arrays. In the case of two sources, an alternating projection procedure is applied to the ML method to estimate the two DOA's from the observed data. The ML algorithm is shown to be effective in locating sound sources of various types, e.g., vehicle, music, and even white noise.},
