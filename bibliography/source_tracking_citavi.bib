Based on the recursive EM algorithm, we develop two recursive procedures to estimate the time-varying DOA parameter for narrowband signals. The first procedure requires no prior knowledge about the source movement. The second procedure assumes that the motion of moving sources is described by a linear polynomial model. The proposed recursion updates the polynomial coefficients when a new data arrives. The suggested approaches have two major advantages: simple implementation and easy extension to wideband signals. Numerical experiments show that both procedures provide excellent results in a slowly changing environment. When the DOA parameter changes fast or two source directions cross with each other, the procedure designed for a linear polynomial model has a better performance than the general procedure. Compared to the beamforming technique based on the same parameterization, our approach is computationally favorable and has a wider range of applications.},

 abstract = {The problem of distributed localization for ad hoc wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) is addressed in this paper. WASNs are characterized by low computational resources in each node and by limited connectivity between the nodes. Novel bi-directional tree-based distributed estimation–maximization (DEM) algorithms are proposed to circumvent these inherent limitations. We show that the proposed algorithms are capable of localizing static acoustic sources in reverberant enclosures without a priori information on the number of sources. Unlike serial estimation procedures (like ring-based algorithms), the new algorithms enable simultaneous computations in the nodes and exhibit greater robustness to communication failures. Specifically, the recursive distributed EM (RDEM) variant is better suited to online applications due to its recursive nature. Furthermore, the RDEM outperforms the other proposed variants in terms of convergence speed and simplicity. Performance is demonstrated by an extensive experimental study consisting of both simulated and actual environments.},

 abstract = {Speech enhancement and separation are core problems in audio signal processing, with commercial applications in devices as diverse as mobile phones, conference call systems, hands-free systems, or hearing aids. In addition, they are crucial preprocessing steps for noise-robust automatic speech and speaker recognition. Many devices now have two to eight microphones. The enhancement and separation capabilities offered by these multi- channel interfaces are usually greater than those of single-channel interfaces. Research in speech enhancement and separation has followed two convergent paths, starting with microphone array processing and blind source separation, respectively. These com- munities are now strongly interrelated and routinely borrow ideas from each other. Yet, a comprehensive overview of the common foundations and the differences between these approaches is lacking at present. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap by analyzing a large number of established and recent techniques according to four transverse axes: 1) the acoustic impulse response model, 2) the spatial filter design criterion, 3) the parameter esti- mation algorithm, and 4) optional postfiltering. We conclude this overview paper by providing a list of software and data resources and by discussing perspectives and future trends in the field.},

 abstract = {The problem of mixed signals occurs in many different contexts; one of the most familiar being acoustics. The forward problem in acoustics consists of finding the sound pressure levels at various detectors resulting from sound signals emanating from the active acoustic sources. The inverse problem consists of using the sound recorded by the detectors to separate the signals and recover the original source waveforms. In general, the inverse problem is unsolvable without additional information.

This general problem is called source separation, and several techniques have been developed that utilize maximum entropy, minimum mutual information, and maximum likelihood. In previous work, it has been demonstrated that these techniques can be recast in a Bayesian framework. This paper demonstrates the power of the Bayesian approach, which provides a natural means for incorporating prior information into a source model. An algorithm is developed that utilizes information regarding both the statistics of the amplitudes of the signals emitted by the sources and the relative locations of the detectors. Using this prior information, the algorithm finds the most probable source behavior and configuration. Thus, the inverse problem can be solved by simultaneously performing source separation and localization.

It should be noted that this algorithm is not designed to account for delay times that are often important in acoustic source separation. However, a possible application of this algorithm is in the separation of electrophysiological signals obtained using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG).},

 url = {\url{https://de.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25965-fast-simulation-of-acoustic-room-impulse-responses--image-source-method-}},
 urldate = {2017-09-17},
 abstract = {These files provide a fast implementation of the image-source model (ISM) for the simulation of room impulse responses (RIRs) in small-room acoustics. This implementation produces RIRs that are virtually identical to those obtained with the standard ISM, but the simulations are up to two orders of magnitude faster. This represents a significant advantage when computing a large number of RIRs, e.g., as in the case of moving sound sources and/or microphone array applications.

These files can be used to simulate a sound source moving in a reverberant environment and generate the corresponding samples of audio data received at one or more microphones. This can be done by simply executing the following two commands:

>> fast{\_}ISM{\_}RIR{\_}bank(my{\_}ISM{\_}setup,'fastISM{\_}RIRs.mat');

>> AuData = ISM{\_}AudioData('fastISM{\_}RIRs.mat',SrcSignalVec);

where SrcSignalVec contains the source signal, and my{\_}ISM{\_}setup.m contains the various user-defined parameters needed for the simulation (room dimensions, positions of the microphones, sound source trajectory, desired reverberation time, etc.). The multi-channel matrix of audio data AuData contains the signals generated at each of the sensors.

These files further allow the user to define a range of simulation parameters such as automatic saving of the audio data into a .mat or .wav file, addition of white noise to the resulting signals, how much to crop the generated impulse responses, different ratios of absorption coefficients in the room, etc.

A full documentation of these files, as well as detailed explanations regarding the simulation process can be found at http://www.eric-lehmann.com . Also, please note that several of these files are identical to those provided on my other page \"Image-source method for room impulse response simulation\" ( http://www.mathworks.com.au/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20962 ).

The method implemented in this Matlab code effectively represents an approximation of the reverberant tail in RIRs, which in turn leads to some limitations in practice (see full documentation for more information). For a majority of applications however, this code should allow users to generate proper ISM-based results in a very efficient manner. Please feel free to leave a comment below or drop me a line at the above address to let me know about your results. Thanks!},

Thus the same frequency can be reused even if the user are in the same cell or the user are well separated resulting system capacity improvement. There are two main function of smart antenna, including Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation of user and beamforming towards the user. Successful design of smart antenna depends highly on the performance of DOA estimation algorithm as well as beamforming algorithm. A systematic comparison of the performance of different DOA algorithm like Barlett, Capon, MUSIC has been extensively studied by analyzing the simulation result with MATLAB. Further MUSIC is separately studied in details.},

More pragmatically speaking, the EM algorithm is an iter- ative method that alternates between computing a conditional expectation and solving a maximization problem, hence the name expectation maxi- mization. We will in this work derive the EM algorithm and show that it provides a maximum likelihood estimate. The aim of the work is to show how the EM algorithm can be used in the context of dynamic systems and we will provide a worked example showing how the EM algorithm can be

used to solve a simple system identi cation problem.},

 abstract = {A novel direction of arrival (DOA) estimator for concur- rent speakers in reverberant environment is presented. Re- verberation, if not properly addressed, is known to degrade the performance of DOA estimators. In our contribution, the DOA estimation task is formulated as a maximum like- lihood (ML) problem, which is solved using the expectation- maximization (EM) procedure. The received microphone sig- nals are modelled as a sum of anechoic and reverberant com- ponents. The reverberant components are modelled by a time- invariant coherence matrix multiplied by time-varying rever- beration power spectral density (PSD). The PSDs of the ane- choic speech and reverberant components are estimated as part of the EM procedure. It is shown that the DOA esti- mates, obtained by the proposed algorithm, are less affected by reverberation than competing algorithms that ignore the reverberation. Experimental study demonstrates the benefit of the presented algorithm in reverberant environment using measured room impulse responses (RIRs).},

 abstract = {Geometrical acoustics are used as a standard model for room acoustic design and consulting. Research on room acoustic simulation focuses on a more accurate modeling of propagation effects such as diffraction and other wave effects in rooms, and on scattering. Much progress was made in this field so that wave models also (for example, the boundary element method and the finite differences in time domain) can now be used for higher frequencies. The concepts and implementations of room simulation methods are briefly reviewed. After all, simulations in architectural acoustics are indeed powerful tools, but their reliability depends on the skills of the operator who has to create an adequate polygon model and has to choose the correct input data of boundary conditions such as absorption and scattering. Very little is known about the uncertainty of this input data. With the theory of error propagation of uncertainties it can be shown that prediction of reverberation times with accuracy better than the just noticeable difference requires input data in a quality which is not available from reverberation room measurements.},
