In this section, the central theoretical concepts needed for source localisation and source tracking for sources emitting speech signals, as it is implemented here, are laid out and put into context. This procedure relies on the sparsity assumption of speech signals, which means it does not necessarily generalise to other audio sources like music instruments. First, the signal model is defined, and it is shown, which features of the signal are exploited to estimate the location of its origin. Next, the \gls{gmm} is introduced as a probabilistic model of the \gls{prp} readings at each microphone pair. Last, the \gls{em} algorithm is shown, and it is explained how it can be used to estimate the parameters of a \gls{gmm} to yield the most likely source locations, with respect to the underlying probabilistic model.
