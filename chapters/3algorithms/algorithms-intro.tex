\chapter{Derivation of Algorithms}
\label{chap:algorithms}

The described in the following chapter have been derived in \cite{Schwartz2014}. Therefore, the following is based on the work presented in \cite{Schwartz2014} with some additional comments to facilitate understanding of how the algorithms are adapted to be used in location estimation and source tracking application.


First, the probabilistic model is introduced, where the \gls{gmm} introduced in Section \ref{sec:gmm} is used to model the \gls{prp}. Next, the algorithm for location estimation of sources is derived, where the \gls{em} algorithm is adapted to estimate the parameters of the \gls{gmm}. Last, the algorithms for source tracking are presented and discussed briefly.
