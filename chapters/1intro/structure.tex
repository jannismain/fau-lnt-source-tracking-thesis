\section{Structure of Thesis}
\label{chap:1structure}

Beginning with chapter \ref{chap:2theory}, the theoretical concepts that the algorithms for location estimation and tracking reviewed in this thesis are based upon will be introduced. Subsequently, in chapter \ref{chap:algorithms} these algorithms will then be formally defined. In chapter \ref{chap:implementation} the implementation of these algorithms in \matlab is shown and test scenarios to evaluate these implementations are defined (all relevant code is included in \ref{sec:appCode}). The results of these tests are presented and discussed in chapter \ref{chap:results}. Finally, the findings of this thesis are summarized in chapter \ref{chap:concl} and a conclusion towards the applicability of these findings to the general performance of the reviewed algorithms is drawn.
