\section{Setting Constraints}
\label{chap:1constraints}

This thesis is approaching the problem of source localisation and tracking using the \gls{em} algorithm to estimate the parameters of a \gls{gmm}. Other methods, like particle filters or Kalman filters, that are often used in this context and provide promising results (see \cite{Lehmann2007} for source tracking using a particle filter and \cite{Gannot2012} for source tracking using a Kalman filter), are not subject of this thesis. In addition, as this thesis mostly reimplements the algorithms for location estimation and tracking found in \cite{Schwartz2014}, the focus of this thesis will be on the evaluation of these algorithms performance in varying environments, rather than the algorithm derivation itself. For the derivation itself, only the core elements shall be reiterated.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Number of speakers a-priori known
	\item Source Tracking: CREM or TREM or both?
\end{itemize}
