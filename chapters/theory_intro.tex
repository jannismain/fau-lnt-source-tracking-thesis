To understand the source tracking algorithm introduced in the subsequent chapters, a firm understanding of the Expectation-Maximization-Algorithm (hereafter called EM-Algorithm), as well as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) is required. Lastly, also the basic signal processing concepts are revised, which will be focused on the properties of the system at hand (multiple sources in a reverberant and noisy environment) and the application of the short-time fourier transformation (STFT) as a way to solve the problem at hand in the frequency-domain.
