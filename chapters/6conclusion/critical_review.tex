    \item Implementation
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mix signals in STFT-Domain directly, instead of calculating $Y*X$ in the STFT-Domain, transforming back into time-domain to mix signals only to transform back into STFT domain for PRP calculation.
        \item Fixed mean, fixed variance: Is this really the best model for this problem?
        \item Could remove reliance on gridpoints by also estimating mean and only having $S$ Gaussian components instead of $T\cdot K\cdot |\mathcal{P}|$
