\begin{itemize}
    \item wall distance seems to have no effect on localisation performance
    \item for $S=3$, $S=4$ and $S=6$, requiring 1.5m distance from the wall seemed to have a slightly positive effect
    \item but results from $S=5$ and $S=7$ are identical across all wall distances
    \item Therefore, assumption that bad performance could be due to many sources near to a wall is not confirmed
    \item Could be tested for larger room.
\end{itemize}
