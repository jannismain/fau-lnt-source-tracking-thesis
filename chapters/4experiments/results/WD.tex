\autoref{fig:trialWD} shows, that restricting the source positions by requiring a minimum wall distances only has a small effect on the localisation error. For $S=3$, 4 and 6 the median, mean and upper whisker of the \gls{mae} for $d_{s,\text{min}}^w=1.5$~m are slightly below the other two parameter values. Therefore, requiring the sources to be located towards the middle of the room achieves a slight performance improvement. However, this requirement is rather strict considering the otherwise contrained setup. $d_{s,\text{min}}^w=1.5$~m would only leave a ${3\text{~m}\times 3\text{~m}}$ area for possible source locations, which is only half the width and height of the simulated room.
