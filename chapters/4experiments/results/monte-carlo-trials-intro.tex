\subsubsection{Single Parameter Evaluations}

For the following trials, the base parameter set described in \autoref{table:parameterset} is used while one parameter is isolated and localisation performance is analysed across a range of values for this parameter. The sample size $n$ for each evaluation is reported with each box plot. A target of $n=200$ should provide a large enough sample to get meaningful results. Where the sample size exceeds $n=200$, results of other evaluation trials could be reused for this particular evaluation. The author was careful not to introduce any bias by selectively stopping or continuing data collection until a certain result was reached.
