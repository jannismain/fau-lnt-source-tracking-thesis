\section{Results}
\label{chap:results}

The source localisation results will be presented in the form of box plots, where the x-axis displays the number of sources $S$ and the y-Axis displays the \gls{mae}, as defined in \eqref{eq:mae}, in metre. A common box plot as shown in \autoref{fig:boxplot-reference} consists of the following elements: the median, displayed as a horizontal line, represents the 50\% percentile (also: second quantile) or the "middle" of the dataset by datapoints ordered from low to high values. The box around the median indicates the 25\% and 75\% percentile (also called first and third quantile). The range between the first and third quantile is called the \gls{iqr}. The mean value of the data is represented by a cross. The vertical lines originating from the box are called whiskers and span $1.5$ times the \gls{iqr} repectively. Every datapoint with a value higher (lower) than the value corresponding to the 75\% (25\%) percentile plus (minus) $1.5\times$\gls{iqr} is considered an outlier and plotted as a transparent dot. The more outliers there are with the same value, the darker the corresponding dot will appear.

A cross has been added to indicate the mean value.}
