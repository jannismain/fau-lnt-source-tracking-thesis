For this evaluation, the amount of reverberation has been increased to T$_{60}=0.6$~s. As expected, the reflection order $r$ has a significant negative effect on localisation performance. In addition, $r=3$ seems to strike a good balance between a realistic simulation environment and managable computational complexity. The \gls{mae} is right in between of either having no reverberation ($r=0$) or fully simulating all reverberations ($r=$~max). In general, this validates the choice of $r=3$ as default parameter for most other evaluations. However, it has to be noted that the effect other parameters might exhibit to have on \gls{mae}, might be diminished by not fully simulating all parts of the reverberation. Therefore, for trials where reverberation is the explicit target of the evaluation (e.g., for the evaluation of T$_{60}$), the additional computational complexity is accepted in order to achieve more accurate results. For all other trials, where $r=3$ is choosen to achieve a larger sample size, the additional negative effect of a more realistic simulation with $r=$~max has to be kept in mind when interpreting the results.
