The mean localisation error for a minimum required source distance seems to be identical for 0.1m - 0.5m. With a required distance of 1.0m although, localisation performance deteriorates significantly for $S>3$. This is surprising, as intuitively, the more space there is between the sources, the easier it should be for the algorithm to estimate the location for each individual source more precisely. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item increasing md does not yield better performance overall
    \item for 0.1-0.5m, effect seems to be negligible
    \item md=1.0m has severe negative effects on performance
    \item this might be due to more sources being placed close to the wall (to follow the minimum distance requirement)
\end{itemize}
