The expected effect of a higher $d_{s,\text{min}}$ is, that it improves the localisation performance, as it eliminates cases, in which localisation would fail due to undistinguishably close sources. The results in \autoref{fig:trialMD} show that this is indeed the case for ${d_{s,\text{min}}=0.1~\text{m}}$ to ${d_{s,\text{min}}=0.5~\text{m}}$, as the latter consistently outperforms all other configurations. Against the initial intuition however, ${d_{s,\text{min}}=1.0~\text{m}}$ does not improve localisation performance. In fact, the \gls{mae} for the highest $d_{s,\text{min}}$ is in the same range as the lower two for $S>3$. One possible explanation for this behaviour is, that a minimum required distance of 1m is actually disadvantageous, because it forces more sources to be closer to the microphones. The space in the middle of the room is considered favorable for localisation, as each microphone pair will provide good readings of sources located there. Therefore, the space close to or around the microphone pairs is deemed unfavourable, as the microphones close to the source might have a steep angle of incidence in relation to the source signal, and the other microphones are far away and presumably dominated by other sources signals. The liberal space requirements could mean, that more sources are placed in these unfavourable positions, thereby decreasing localisation performance. A preliminary investigation in the extreme coordinates of these trials did provide some evidence that this is indeed the case, but further examination is necessary to fully account for this behaviour.
