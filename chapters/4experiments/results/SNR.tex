In \autoref{fig:trialSNR} the results of the \gls{snr} evaluation are presented. These show that, from ${\text{SNR}=30~\text{dB}}$ onwards, adding more noise to the received signal increases the localisation error and therefore decreases localisation performance. However, comparing the trials without noise to those with the least amount of noise ${\text{SNR}=30~\text{dB}}$ suggests, that a minimal amount of noise does not always decrease localisation performance. In fact, for $S=3$ and $S=4$ the algorithm performs best with ${\text{SNR}=30~\text{dB}}$, marginally better than in a noiseless environment. For all other $S$, the results for minimal noise and no noise are about the same in regards to the variance, median and mean of the \gls{mae}.
