\begin{itemize}
    \item not surprisingly, more noise (lower SNR) means worse location estimates
    \item Worst estimates for lowest SNR
    \item With increasing SNR, estimates then get better
    \item Consistent over all trials of different number of sources
    \item But, SNR=5dB decreased mean-err and size of 95\% percentile for 3-7 sources compared to no noise.
    \item Results seem to indicate, that SNR=5 improves location estimation performance, while more than 5dB decreases performance compared to noiseless environment
\end{itemize}
