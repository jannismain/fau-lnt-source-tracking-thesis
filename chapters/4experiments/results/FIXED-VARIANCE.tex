The results in \autoref{fig:trialVarianceFixed} show, that the extreme values $\sigma^2_{\text{fixed}}=0.1$ and $\sigma^2_{\text{fixed}}=5.0$ yield significantly higher localisation errors across all $S$ compared to the other initial variances. Overall, $\sigma^2_{\text{fixed}}=2$ performs best for all but $S=7$, where $\sigma^2_{\text{fixed}}=1$ results in a slightly lower mean and median \gls{mae}. Comparing these results with the evaluation above, where the variance has not been fixed, does reveal that there is no performance advantage in fixing the variance. However, estimating the variance uses about 30\% of the computation time per iteration. Therefore, not estimating the variance reduces the runtime of the \gls{em} algorithm by 30\%, which amounts to about $1$ second per iteration (on the hardware described in \autoref{sec:computationalComplexity}). This improvement, however, comes with the challenge of choosing a good initial value for $\sigma^2_{\text{fixed}}$. As we have seen in \autoref{fig:trialVarianceFixed}, a bad fixed variance can lead to a significant worse localisation performance, at least for $S>2$. Therefore, according to these results, estimating the variance is the better option when trying to optimise the localisation algorithm for performance.
