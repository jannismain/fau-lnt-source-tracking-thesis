\paragraph{Variations on Experiments in \citeauthor{Schwartz2014} \citeyearpar{Schwartz2014}}
For these variations on the replication trials above, the results of which are presented in \autoref{fig:resultsReplicationAlternativeRotated} and \autoref{fig:resultsReplicationAlternativeEqual}, the original initialisation has been modified. In the first trial, it has been rotated by $90^{\circ}$, now horizontally dividing the room along $p_y=3$. With this initialisation, both sources are located in the non-zero area of a single $\psips$, which should render the seperation into two different $\psips$ meaningless. In the second trial, $\psips$ is initialised with equal values across the whole room for both sources. This shows, how the localisation performs when only a single $\psip$ is used, as both estimates w will be identical. It is also the only trial so far, where no prior knowledge about the sources is introduced before starting the \gls{em} iterations.

First, the results show that the localisation performance was not altered by using these alternative initialisations. In both trials, the sources were identified correctly and the \gls{mae} is zero. Even the pattern of the spurious Gaussian component weights is identical to the original replication trial. Therefore it can be concluded that the different initialisations of $\psips$ used above does not impact the results of the source localisation algorithm. Further, the identical performance exhibited when equally initialising all $\psips$, effectively removing the $S$-dimension like proposed at the end of \autoref{sec:algLocEst}, allows for the optimisation of the algorithms complexity and memory requirements. This, in turn, permits trials with larger $S$, as the memory requirement does no longer increase with additional sources. Therefore, the upcoming trials can be performed for $2-7$~sources, which allows for the evaluation of the localisation performance in a less sparse environment. \FloatBarrier
