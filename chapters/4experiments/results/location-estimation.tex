\subsection{Source Localisation}
For the following trials, the base parameter set described in Table \ref{table:parameterset} is used. For each parameter, all other parameters are kept constant, while the parameter in question is tested with different values. The results will be presented in box plots, where the median is displayed as a horizontal line, the mean is indicated using an 'x' marker, the lower and upper limits of the box represent the first and third quantile respectively, and the lower and upper whiskers (the vertical lines originating from each box) represent the 2.5\% and 97.5\% percentile respectively. Datapoints outside of this range are outliers and will be omitted from the box plots below. The existence of outliers and their effect on the distribution of results can be inferred from the remaining elements.
