The red rectangles represent the first-order image expansion, where every acoustic wave arriving at the receiver after being reflected one time (dotted red arrows) is simulated as a direct arrival wave (red arrows) to the virtual source (red dot) in the image of the room. The image is created by mirroring the room at the wall where the reflection occured. The grey rectangles represent the second-order images for signal waves that are subject to two reflections (dotted grey arrow).}

To conduct the experimental part of this thesis, simulation as means of data collection has been chosen over real recordings, as simulated acoustic environments are more flexible compared to a laboratory environment. To simulate the experimental setup \alt{in it's different configurations} described in Section \ref{sec:setup}, the \emph{image-source method} for small-room acoustics is used \cite{Allen1979}. The basic idea of this method is to simulate an arriving signal wave reflected from the walls as a wave arriving directly from a virtual sources, mirrored at the reflecting wall.\alt{direct arrival waves of a mirror image of the room on the reflecting wall.} Two parameters determine, how many images are created during simulation with everything else being equal: The reverberation time T$_{60}$, the time it takes the source signal to have decreased by 60dB after the exciting source is switched off, and the reflection order $r$, which is equal to the maximum order of the image expansion. Instead of explicitly stating T$_{60}$, the wall reflection coefficients $\bm\beta = [\beta_1~\beta_2~\dots~\beta_6]$ could also be provided, simulating different types of walls, like concrete walls or walls with sound proofing. There is one coefficient per wall, including the ceiling and the floor, for a total of six coefficients. Whenever the signal crosses a wall into another image (i.e., being reflected), it is attenuated by the $\beta$-coefficient of that wall. An example of a second-order image expansion is shown in \autoref{fig:imageMethod}.

This method allowed for experiments, where a controlled acoustic environment in form of a small, rectangular room is required, that can be easily adjusted. For many experiments\alt{experiments with budget- and time-constraints}, constructing such an environment in a laboratory is prohibitive, which is why the image method has gained widespread popularity since its inception in \citeyear{Allen1979}~\cite{Allen1979} and has been used in a wide range of studies \cite{Champagne1996}.
