\section{Methodology}
\label{chap:methodology}

First, the setup is presented in which the sources for localisation and tracking are simulated, and the evaluation trials are executed. Next, the image-source method for simulating small room acoustics is explained, and its limitations are discussed. Then, a performance measure is defined to evaluate and compare the results of different localisation trials. Last, the evaluation scenarios for different trials for both source localisation and source tracking are defined.
