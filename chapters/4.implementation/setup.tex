The setup, that is going to be simulated, consists of a rectangular room, that is 6m wide, 6m long and 6m high. There are a total of 12 microphone pairs, 3 of them on each wall. The position of each microphone pair can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:setup}.\todo{Explain reason for positioning of the microphone pairs} The sources are going to be placed within this room with fixed or random positions, depending on the evaluation scenario, and are described using one-dimensional position vectors with x-, y- and z-coordinates (i.e. $\begin{bmatrix} 2&3&3  \end{bmatrix}$ describes a source at the position $x=3, y=3$ and $z=3$)
