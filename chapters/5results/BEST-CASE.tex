\subsubsection{Best Case vs. Worst Case Simulation Scenario}

The best and worst case scenarios have to be understood in terms of the constraints, that have been applied to the parameter set.

A colored bold value means, that the base scenario value was equal to the scenario indicated by the color, whereas missing of colored values in a row means that the value was hold constant for all scenarios.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item best case has almost optimal localisation for 2-4 sources (third quantile of datapoints still 0, mean>0 allows for conclusion, that few but big outliers are present)
	\item guessing gets increasingly better with number of sources, as the chance is better for each guess to be close to a source
	\item consistently, 75\% of worst case results are better than 25\% of guessed results
	\item also, conservative choice of base parameter set can be seen, especially for 2-4 sources.
	\item For more sources and less favorable conditions, the effect of the simulation parameters seems to diminish and the results behave very much like guessing results, just a little bit better
\end{itemize}
