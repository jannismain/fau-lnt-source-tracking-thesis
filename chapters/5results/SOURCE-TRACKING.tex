\begin{itemize}
    \item After convergence from the initial variance to the variance inherent to the data, both ways of recursively updating the variance yield the same results.
    \item CREM converges significantly faster than TREM
    \item CREM seems to have converged after 40 timesteps
    \item TREM only converges after more than 100 timesteps
    \item The variance inherent to the data seems to range from 0.8 to 1.8
\end{itemize}
