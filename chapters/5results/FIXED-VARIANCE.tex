\subsubsection{Fixed Variance}

Now, fixed variance:

	\end{tikzpicture}
	
	\caption{Evaluation results for fixed and estimated variance}
	\label{fig:boxplotVariance}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Extreme values for fixed variance yield significant worse performance than more moderate values
    \item Optimal variance seems to be around 2
    \item 0.1 and 0.5 were outperformed across all number of sources
    \item 1, 2 and 3 performed almost equally well, although 3 was slightly worse for 4-6 sources
\end{itemize}

For comparison, estimated variance with same initial values for variance as fixed variance evaluation:

	\end{tikzpicture}
	
	\caption{Evaluation results for estimated variance with different $\sigma^2_0$}
	\label{fig:boxplotVariance}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Localisation performance basically identical across different $sigma^2_0$
    \item Looks like variance converges to a value quickly, so different initialisations have no effect
    \item Now of interest, which value the variance converges to when estimated
    \item Fixed variance trials allow for the assumption, that estimated variance converges to a value between 1 and 3
\end{itemize}
