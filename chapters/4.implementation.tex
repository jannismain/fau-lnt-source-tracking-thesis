\chapter{Implementation Details}
\label{chap:implementation}
Before any results can be produced, the described algorithms and setup have to be implemented and tested within a simulation framework, that allows for easy parameter customisation and evaluation. Therefore, what follows is the description of the different parts of the implementation that allows for the evaluation of the algorithms described in \ref{chap:algorithms}. First, the setup is defined and the simulation framework is laid out. Then, the implementation of both source localisation and source tracking are discussed. Lastly, evaluation scenarios are established to analyse the possibilities and limitations of the implementation. This will assist in drawing conclusions about the strengths and shortcomings of the algorithm in this particular setup and may allow for more general findings to be deducted.
