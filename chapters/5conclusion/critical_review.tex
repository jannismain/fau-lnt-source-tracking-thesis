- Certain Parameters have not been evaluated
    - Static
        - Correct Choice for K
        - Other Microphone types (Omnidirectional probably do not yield best performance, Hypercardioid might be better choice)
        - Other Microphone Layout have not been tested
        - Performance in different Room layout (bigger, smaller)
        - Grid Resolution?
        - Issues with certain wall reflections are not examined
        - Other, better prior values for psi? (favor grid points in the middle of the room to counter bad reading directly at microphones)
    - Tracking
        - More continuous speech samples
        - Closer examine role of gamma (in our trials, smaller gamma worked better. In Schwartz2014, Gamma=1 worked better)
        - More than 2 sources
        - Performance Measure for Tracking required for more data-driven evaluation

- Further Research
    - Integration with VAD for more reliable tracking
    - Improvement through optimised grid search (from coarse to fine)
        - solves memory issue
        - provides faster execution time
