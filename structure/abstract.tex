The task of acoustic source localisation and tracking has both a long history in the signal processing literature as well as many modern applications. In this thesis, the \glsentrylong{em} algorithm is utilised to solve this task, estimating the parameters of a \glsentrylong{gmm} which models the spatial information available in the source signals. Recursive variations of the algorithm for source localisation are presented to track moving speakers over time. Both Source Localisation and Tracking are tested in a simulation setup, where the algorithms performance is evaluated in different scenarios. These evaluations show, %TODO: Finish Abstract
