%\subsubsection{Set Parameters Routine}
%The \texttt{config_update} function initializes all parameters, variables and constants required by the remaining functions and methods. This is done up front to have easy access to the parameter set and a single file to adjust when a different configuration is needed. It provides a set of default parameters, that can be overriden by input arguments. This way, each evaluation script can call \texttt{config_update} with it's specific set of adjustments to the default configuration without the need to adjust the function itself or redefine all other values. The list of default parameters is provided in \ref{app:defaultParameters}.
%The function also relies on two helper functions, namely \texttt{get\_random\_sources} and \texttt{get\_trajectory\_from\_source}. The first ensures, that the random positions of the sources comply with the location constraints expressed in section \ref{sec:setup}, whereas the latter takes source positions and movement vectors and returns a trajectory vector, which is needed to compute the \gls{rir} of a moving source.
